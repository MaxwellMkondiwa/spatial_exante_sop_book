    "text": "Preface\nWhat is all this? Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for a research process which should be driven by a quest to discover the unknown seems far-fetched. It is far-fetched indeed as it should be. Let alone for spatial exante which depends very much on what the context demands. Our purpose for these SOPs is to standardize the spatial exante process so as to shorten the amount of time researchers spend on coding the common building blocks of spatial exante workflows[1].\nThe choice of which methods to showcase in the SOP reflects our taste and level of knowledge. It also reflects our goal which is to provide a prioritization assessment framework for potential investments.\nWe focus on three indicators for prioritization: yield gains, profit gains and robustness to risk.\n[1] We develop the SOPs following advice from Hollman et al (2020) [https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008095].\nAcknowledgements: We thank CSISA and EiA for funding this work.

    "text": "1.1 Overview\nCSISA-EiA Spatial Exante Standard Operating Procedure (SpSOP) is a suite of validated toolkits that use economic theory, econometrics, and mathematical optimization models to target investments of different agronomic innovations at disaggregated spatial scales, as well as evaluating the returns on these investments. The returns are expressed depending on the toolkit as yield gains, profit gains, probability of getting a threshold level of yield gains or profit gains, yield or profit risk, producer surplus, financial indicators like cost benefit ratio and net present value, and willingness to pay measures.\nWe start with exploratory toolkit which involves literature review, back of the envelope calculations, and stakeholder engagements[1]. In the standard procedures for evaluating agricultural research (as described in Alston et al 1995), this procedure involves using scoring and other short cut approaches. This procedure is not a replacement for the other more objective and data grounded procedures we discuss next. It is a starting point for doing spatial exante work as it guides the nature and scope of toolkits to use next.\nThe next toolkit in the system assesses whether there are substantial economic gains for a farmer who is either risk agnostic or risk averse to likely adopt the technology. This toolkit assumes that the farmers are individually too small to affect the prices and quantities of other farmers.\nIn following toolkit, we relax these assumptions to estimate the producer and consumer surplus while considering farmers’ demand and supply price behaviour and equilibrium relationships. The two toolkits presented assume that the technology already exists and that all that remains is to increase its adoption.\nIn the final toolkit, we present a case of first ascertaining whether there is adoption potential given spatially explicit endowments and whether by adding attributes to the technology, farmers are then more likely to adopt it. We then use that system to compute the economic value of that adoption to the farmers.\nHow does one choose which toolkits to use? We present next a guide map to choosing the analytical methods given the available data, expertise and time.\n[1] Within CSISA and EiA, the CAPTAIN tool (now called PAiCE) is a clear example of this toolkit.",

    "section": "1.2 Guidelines to comprehensive spatial quantitative exante toolkits",
    "text": "1.2 Guidelines to comprehensive spatial quantitative exante toolkits\nThis paper has provides a list of spatial quantitative exante toolkits that are used to prioritize potential investments. These toolkits mostly use existing survey data or baseline data that most projects ideally collect prior to implementation.\nFigure 1 shows a guidemap to selecting which exante approach to use for a selected study. We categorize the decision steps into four layers. First, one has to conduct a literature review, back of the envelope calculations of structural changes in the economy, and stakeholder engagements. This layer needs to be done regardless of the comprehensive approaches that are later used in the spatial exante assessment. It is possible to stop and start implementing at this point if prior exante studies were already conducted on the topic of interest and at a sufficient scale. In the second layer, one gathers all the necessary datasets required for the exante work. If there is no data, then instead of scaling the interventions, it is best to work with stakeholders to design on station, on-farm experiments, quantitative and qualitative surveys to start gathering evidence to be used for exante.\nIf survey data exist already, then one needs to start with the spatial profitability and risk assessment toolkit. In this tookit, the researcher needs to ask if the technology in question is sufficiently studied elsewhere such that there are already functional forms to use the parametric approach. If not clear on this then, he/she may use the causal ML based approaches. The researcher may use the spatial Bayesian krigging approach if the targeting is to focus on locations to implement including out of sample. He/she may consider the policy learning optimization approach if he/she is interested in understanding the indicators to use when partitioning who needs to be prioritized beyond the spatial aspects.\nIf crop simulation and long-term experimental datasets are available, one can use the spatial profitability and risk assessment toolkit as well. But in addition, he/she may be interested in using the evidence from these experiments to suggest new combinations of treatments that should be tested or scaled beyond what is observed to be beneficial. For that, the researcher can use the modern portfolio approaches (i.e., mean-variance optimization or mean-conditional value at risk optimization). If instead he/she is just interested at recommending for each grid the most robust practice for scaling, then he/she can use the willingness to pay bounds approach which recommends the best practice for any risk averse farmer to find it optimal to follow that strategy.\nThe spatial profitability assessment toolkit and the spatial optimization toolkit will provide an individual assessment of the benefits of. However, one may be interested to understand if this makes sense socially as well given the demand and supply behavioral patterns (i.e., elasticities). The equilibrium displacement modelling framework also called economic surplus approach is the traditional way of assessing producer and consumer surplus for the new agronomic technology. This approach will utilize supply/demand elasticities, the spatially explicit yield gains and cost reduction estimates and the assumed adoption trends to evaluate the returns on investments at a disaggregated level.\nWhat if the new technology is just a variant of an old technology. For example, a new mix of herbicides or a new variety. In most cases, these are not widely adopted to warrant a spatial profitability assessment using observational data. In addition, the performance in agronomic trials will likely be misleading because farmers have not yet learned how to use the technology appropriately. How do we predict whether this new technology is will be adopted and that it’s worth investing in. For this, the researcher needs to consider the structural differentiated agronomy toolkit which uses characteristics of the technology and locational characteristics (including farmer demographics) to predict whether the new technology embodying particular traits is worth investing.\nAs it can be seen from the guidemap, these toolkits can be used in tandem because they give different insights into the likely benefits of investing in a particular technology. In addition, these approaches are not exhaustive. Each of the workflows we have presented have several variants and complementary methods that researchers can explore.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Guidemap to selecting spatial exante approaches",

    "text": "2.1 Spatial parametric production function approach with risk\nPurpose: The conventional approach is to estimate a parametric production function (also called crop response function), then use profit maximization or it’s dual cost minimization to identify optimal demand for the associated technology. If risk is considered important, the traditional approach is to assume a quadratic utility function and use mean-variance approaches to assess optimal choices under risk aversion preferences (e.g., Just-Pope production function or moments productions). To use this approach for spatial exante, we use spatial Bayesian models for point-referenced data (Note: spatial econometric approaches can also be used for this extension to the traditional model).\nAdvantages\nDisadvantages\nStylized use case: Are sowing date advisories risk proof?\nWe use CSISA-KVK trial data to understand whether early sowing of wheat and planting of long duration wheat varieties increase mean yield and reduce risk. Workflow Figure 4 shows a workflow for the spatial parametric production function approach. This is categorized into four steps. First, one estimates a production risk function model using either the residual based (e.g., Just-Pope production function) or the moments-based approach using ordinary least squares approach. If there are concerns with endogeneity, then one can correct for these using the instrumental variables approach or other quasi-experimental methods. The simple approach we recommend is using Lewbel (2012) approach. Third, to make the estimate spatially explicit, we recommend using a spatially varying coefficient model to get estimates for each pixel in area of interest. Finally, one can use input and output prices to create economic indicators of interest.\nReplication materials: https://eia2030-ex-ante.github.io/SpatialParametricProduction_Risk_Model/\nKey references:\nAntle, J.M. 1983. “Testing the stochastic structure of production: A flexible moment-based approach”.

    "text": "2.3 Causal ML and policy learning optimization model\nPurpose: To make individualized or personalized recommendations from observational data in a data-driven manner using causal machine learning frameworks.\nAdvantages\n\nData-driven approach of recommending alternatives without making functional form assumptions. This is especially useful for agricultural inputs for which we do not have a clear functional form e.g., irrigation, sowing dates.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nIt requires enough sample sizes for each of the options being compared. This mean that for new innovations which have not been extensively adopted, this approach would not be beneficial.\n\nStylized use case: Targeting sowing date advisories to individual farmers\nWhile sowing date and many other recommendations are made on the basis of climatic, biophysical and economic aspects, there may be several individual level reasons for not following with the recommendation, e.g., family members are busy with other duties during those weeks. We propose a robust methodology that rests on causal machine learning and policy learning to make recommendations that are the most beneficial for each individual farmer.\nInput data requirements: The data required is the same as for any conventional production function or impact assessment. These include yield, agronomic management variables (e.g., fertilizer applied), socio-economic variables, and input and output prices. One however, needs enough sample sizes for the treatment and control groups therefore the method works only for a technology which has been widely adopted.\nToolkit workflow\nFigure 9 shows a step-by-step workflow for implementing the policy learning optimization model.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Workflow for causal ML and policy learning optimization\n\n\nStylized outputs\nThe output of steps 1 to 3 in the workflow are the individual level estimates of the yield gains from the proposed agronomic innovation. Figure 10 shows the distribution of yield gains to early sowing. Everyone in the sample would get a positive yield gain if they advance their planting strategy as compared to sowing after 16 December.  The highest yield gains are with planting before 10th November. However, the results in this figure do not prescribe a recommendation for that farmer. To prescribe a recommendation, we need to assume some objective function of the farmer. Policy learning uses minimum regret as an objective function to prescribe best practice for each farmer.
